# life-vida

Life Vida is a website front-end design I did in my undergraduate school. The idea of this website is to help people create events online & join events created by other people (as how the Eventbirth does). Several front-end techniques are used, including CSS, JavaScript, HTML and materialize, a style class library created by Google.

Interesting fact: the name of this website comes from Vivi la Vida, which means beautiful life.
